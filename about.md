 I am a 3rd year CSE undergrad at Shiv Nadar University. 
As an undergraduate student interested in ubiquitous computing, mHealth and HCI, I have undertaken electives like Social & Information Networks,
Probability & Statistics, and Signals & Systems alongside core courses on Programming Paradigms and Data Structures & Algorithms. My exposure to
these courses, alongside my interactions with doctoral researchers, piqued my interest to foray into sensor-data mining and research within mobile computing. To this end, I have been working as an undergraduate research assistant at SNU since Fall' 21 with a focus on sensor-based classification 
of interaction monitoring using smartphone and wearable sensor data - specifically, distinguishing between co-location and face-to-face interactions. 
I was motivated by the project objectives, namely, research regarding interaction and group monitoring - which are major defining factors in detecting existing health issues, both physical and mental. Our primary focus is on dyadic and triadic interactions as these are the most p revalent group size 
and subsequently, understanding the various combinations of human, device and context features that affect our day-to-day social encounters. I have 
worked on the extraction of sensor-based data of smartphones and smart wearables using a sensor framework using device interaction states, human activity recognition (HAR) and location trajectories, along with detection of groups in a community setting, using WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy. As part of this project, my role has been to combine aspects like position, orientation and placement of the user device to get precise device state as well as accurate activity recognition for testing the prototype application and for improving the le arning methodologies for common interactions. Currently, we are testing device state and feature variables for in-the-wild interaction versus non-interaction (co-location) scenarios, and plan to submit the research for review in the Proceedings of the ACM on IMWUT, later this year.

<strong> My objectives are to focus on research within mHealth and multi-modal sensor data while studying more about frameworks involved in improving the precision and accuracy of predictions and data-labelling using semi-supervised learning. I am enthused to work as a research intern or assistant on diverse projects in mobile and ubiquitous computing, and at the same time delve into advanced sensor data sampling, data distributions, data forecasting & aggregation. </strong>
