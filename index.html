<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    I'm a recent graduate with a degree in Computer Science from Shiv Nadar University, India. 
    I currently work as a Software Engineer at Hewlett Packard Enterprise. As an undergraduate student interested in ubiquitous computing, mHealth and HCI, I have undertaken electives like Intro to ML, Artificial Intelligence, Social & Information Networks, Probability & Statistics, and Signals & Systems alongside core courses on Programming Paradigms and Data Structures & Algorithms. My exposure to these courses, alongside my interactions with doctoral researchers, piqued my interest to foray into sensor-data mining and research within mobile computing.
    I may be new to the domain, but I bring fresh perspectives, enthusiasm, and an eagerness to learn and grow. I want to explore more research domains and am eager to contribute to innovative projects, leveraging my problem-solving skills and adaptability. I believe that I communicate very well, and I have the confidence to put forward my views and learn from my mistakes. Always eager to learn more! Hoping to have a positive impact on the world.

    Apart from that, I enjoy painting, reading books, doing <a href="https://leetcode.com/sohinibhattacharya/"><span style="color: #eacfa5;">leetcode</span></a> and would like to get back to playing tennis again. Aiming to learn how to play the piano someday.
