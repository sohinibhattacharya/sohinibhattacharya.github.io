My current research interests include wearable sensor data, data mining and interaction monitoring in daily social premises. Having worked with WiFi and BLE, I would like to understand and work with real-time location systems. Being a beginner, I want to work on the data processing aspect of the sensor signals and other elements like position, orientation and placement of the user device to get precise activity recognition. I am driven further to explore sensor-based state classification and different use-cases of wearables, using active and passive data sensing to distinguish between interaction and co-location. 

Alternatively, I am also interested in working with physiological sensors. I have been studying EEG and signal processing. The application of EEG signals in emotion detection and neuromarketing is prevalent in today's world. Having studied Fourier Transform, FFT and Laplace Transform, I have basic theoretical knowledge of signals and systems. I want to explore similar domains like the use of electrodermal activities to detect interactions and health issues. I am expanding my understanding of ML/DL models and their practical implementation using Python Libraries.
