<h1> Research Experience </h1>

<strong><h3>○ Sensing In-Person Interactions & Social Groups using SmartWearables   [October 2021-present]</h3></strong>
<br>
<br>
-Co-designed sensor-framework for human activity recognition, device placement or orientation, and ambient
context e.g location, co-location etc. using WiFi and BLE.
<br>
-Worked on combining device, context and finally, human level features for recognition and detection of
in-person interactions, as versus simple co-location.
<br>
-Implementing a prototype library in Kotlin using Android smartphones and WearOS wearables for testing the
proposed system.
<br>
-Worked with MicroPython for acquiring sensor data from Micro:bit v2, retrofitted as a wrist-worn
programmable wearable.

<h1> Course Projects </h1>

<strong><h3>○ Disease Spread & Pattern Detection using Dynamic Colocation Networks    [Jan-May, 2022]</h3></strong>
<br>
<br>
-Investigating face-to-face encounters, co-presence & contact networks with low spatial resolution.
<br>
-Down-sampling methods to simulate epidemic spread, and using SEIR model to understand context dependent results of interaction monitoring using wearable sensor data.
<br>
-Devise containment & vaccination strategies on mobility patterns and interactions.
